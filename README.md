The EN689/1995 and EN689/2018 are the European standards employed to assess the compliance of similar exposed groups (SEGs) of workers to airborne substances and comparing workers' exposures with occupational exposure limit (OEL).

The Preliminary Test and Statistical Test are the compliance strategies employed in both EN689s that were reported in the package as "Phase One" and "Phase Two", respectivily. 

The BOHS-NVvA of 2011 reports Individual Compliance test to assess temporal and individual variability in (average) exposure within a SEG. "Phase3" and Individual "Compliance" are the functions.

OverExposure and Exceedance calculations were integrated as well.
