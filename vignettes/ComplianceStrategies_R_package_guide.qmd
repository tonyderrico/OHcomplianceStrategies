# Introduction

The **Compliance Strategies for Occupational Airborne Exposures** package provides methods to assess the compliance of similarly exposed groups (**SEGs**) of workers with European exposure regulations. These strategies are derived from the following standards:

-   **EN689:1995** and **EN689:2018** for the assessment of airborne substance exposure and Occupational Exposure Limit (**OEL**) compliance.
-   **BOHS-NVvA (2011)** for individual and between-worker compliance.

## Application

The package includes several compliance tests and calculations for overexposure and exceedance, including:

-   **Phase One**: **Preliminary Test** and **Statistical Test** (EN689 standards)
-   **Phase Two**: **Individual Compliance** and **Between-Worker Variance** (BOHS-NVvA)
-   **Phase Three**: Additional tests to evaluate compliance with more detailed statistical models.

## ShinyApp

The app allows you to assess compliance strategies for testing workers' exposure to airborne substances against OELs.

# Background

The tests included in this package are based on the following methods:

### EN689:1995 Preliminary Test

-   Compares exposure concentrations to OEL.
-   Determination of compliance or uncertainty based on exposure indices and number of measurements.

### EN689:2018 Statistical Test

-   Determines compliance based on the distribution of exposure measurements.
-   Includes probability calculations for compliance (e.g., **\< 5% probability** for compliance).

### BOHS-NVvA Individual Compliance Test

-   Uses analysis of variance to test if individual workers’ exposure exceeds the OEL.

# Package Dependencies

This package relies on the following R packages: - **tolerance** - **lme4** - **dplyr** - **FSA**

## Functions Overview

### Phase 1 - EN689:1995

``` r
#' Phase 1, EN689 1995 - Testing Compliance for One Measurement
#'
#' Compliance, uncertain compliance, or non-compliance can be evaluated
#' for one measurement. The exposure index is calculated as worker measurement / OEL.
#' Compliance is achieved if the index is ≤ 0.1.
#' If the index is > 0.1 but ≤ 1, there is no decision ("UC"),
#' and additional measurements are necessary (at least three).
#' Non-Compliance is reached if the measurement > OEL or if the exposure index > 1.
#'
#' @param measurements One measurement under assessment
#' @param OEL Occupational Exposure Limit of the agent
#' @return Compliance ("C"), Non-Compliance ("NC"), or Uncertainty of Compliance ("UC")
#' @export

phase1EN1995_k1 <- function(measurements, OEL)
```

``` r
#'Phase 1, EN689 1995  - testing compliance for at least Three measurements
#'
#'Compliance, uncertain compliance or non-compliance can be evaluated
#'for at least three measurements. Calculation of exposure indeces is performed (worker measurement/OEL).
#'Compliance is achieved if all indeces are below or equal to 0.25.
#'If at least an index is greater than 0.25 but all indeces are lower/equal than 1 and the
#'geometric mean of the measurements is lower/equal than 0.5, Compliance is accomplished.
#'Contrarly, there is no decision ("UC").
#'There is Non-Compliance if at least a measurement is greater than the OEL
#'and/or if at least an exposure index is greater than 1.
#' @param measurements At least 3 measurements
#' @param OEL Occupational Exposure Limit of the agent
#' @return Compliance (C"), Non-Compliance ("NC") or Uncertainty of Compliance ("UC")
#' @export

phase1EN1995_k3 <- function(measurements, OEL)
```

### Phase 1 - EN689:2018

``` r
#'Phase 1, EN689 2018  - testing compliance for 3 measurements
#'
#'Compliance, uncertain compliance or non-compliance of a SEG can be
#'evaluated for three measurements. Compliance is achieved if all of
#'the measurements are below or equal to 0.1xOEL. There is Uncertain Compliance if
#'at least a measurement is greater than 0.1xOEL but below the OEL.
#'There is Non-Compliance if at least a measurement is greater than OEL.
#' @param measurements Three measurements
#' @param OEL Occupational Exposure Limit of the agent
#' @return Compliance ("C"), Non-Compliance ("NC") or Uncertainty of Compliance ("UC")
#' @export

phase1EN2018_k3 <- function(measurements, OEL)
```

``` r
#'Phase 1, EN689 2018  - testing compliance for 4 measurements
#'
#'Compliance, uncertain compliance or non-compliance of a SEG can be
#'evaluated for four measurements. Compliance is achieved if all of the measurements
#'are below or equal to 0.15xOEL. There is Uncertain Compliance if at least a
#'measurement is greater than 0.15xOEL but below the OEL. There is Non-Compliance
#'if at least a measurement is greater than OEL.
#' @param measurements Four measurements 
#' @param OEL Occupational Exposure Limit of the agent
#' @return Compliance ("C"), Non-Compliance ("NC") or Uncertainty of Compliance ("UC")
#' @export

phase1EN2018_k4 <- function(measurements, OEL)
```

``` r
#'Phase 1, EN689 2018  - testing compliance for 5 measurements
#'
#'Compliance, uncertain compliance or non-compliance of a SEG can be evaluated for five measurements. 
#'Compliance is achieved if all of the measurements are below or equal to 0.2xOEL. 
#'There is Uncertain Compliance if at least a measurement is greater than 0.2xOEL but below the OEL. 
#'There is Non-Compliance if at least a measurement is greater than OEL.
#' @param measurements Five measurements 
#' @param OEL Occupational Exposure Limit of the agent
#' @return Compliance ("C"), Non-Compliance ("NC") or Uncertainty of Compliance ("UC")
#' @export

phase1EN2018_k5 <- function(measurements, OEL)
```

### Phase 2 - EN689:1995

``` r
#'Phase 2, EN689 1995  - testing compliance exceedance
#'
#' The normal distribution of the measurements is operated, and 99.9th percentile and 95th percentile values are observed to assess 
#' the possible exceedance of the OEL.
#' Compliance or "Green Area" is achieved if the value of the 99,9 the percentile is lower than the OEL, 
#' Uncertain Compliance or "Orange Area" is achieved if
#' the value of the 99.9th percentile is lower than the OEL but the value of 95th percentil is greater than the OEL. 
#' Non Compliance or "Red Area" is achieved if the OEL is lower than the value of the 95th percentile.
#' @param measurements measurements of the SEG under assessment
#' @param OEL Occupational Exposure Limit of the agent
#' @return Green Area, Orange Area or Red Area
#' @export

phase2EN689.1995 <- function(measurements, OEL)
```

### Phase 2 - EN689:2018

``` r
#' Phase 2, EN689 2018 - UTLv (Upper Tolerance Limit value)
#' 
#' This function evaluates compliance with the Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL) 
#' based on the Upper Tolerance Limit value (UTLv), calculated with a 95% Percentile 
#' Confidence Level and a 70% Confidence Level.
#' 
#' The test compares the UTLv with the OEL:
#' - If **UTL > OEL**, there is exceedance → **"Not Compliant"**.
#' - If **UTL < OEL**, the probability of exceedance is acceptable → **"Compliant"**.
#' 
#' @param measurements Numeric vector. At least 6 exposure measurements from the SEG under assessment.
#' @param OEL Numeric. The Occupational Exposure Limit of the agent.
#' @return A character string:
#' - `"Not Compliant"` if `UTL > OEL`
#' - `"Compliant"` if `UTL < OEL`
#' 
#' @export

phase2_UTL <- function(measurements, OEL)
```

### Phase 2 - BOHS/NVvA 2011

``` r
#' Phase 2, BOHS/NVvA & EN689 2018 - U test
#'
#' This function applies the Mann-Whitney U test (70% Confidence) to evaluate SEG compliance 
#' based on the number of measurements performed.
#' 
#' The test compares the calculated U value (pg. 42, EN689 2018) with the U threshold from the Mann-Whitney U table:
#' - If **U > OEL**, there is **Compliance**.
#' - If **U < OEL**, there is **Non-Compliance**.
#' 
#' The function includes U-thresholds for a maximum of 15 measurements per SEG.
#'
#' @param measurements Numeric vector. Measurements of the SEG under assessment (between 6 and 15).
#' @param OEL Numeric. The Occupational Exposure Limit of the agent.
#' 
#' @return A character string:
#' - "Compliant" if `U < threshold`
#' - "Not Compliant" if `U > threshold`
#'
#' @export
phase2_Uvalue <- function(measurements, OEL)
```

### Phase 3 - BOHS/NVvA 2011

``` r
#'Phase 3, BOHS/NvVA 2011  - Between Worker Variance
#'
#' Linear Mixed models using REML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) is performed to calculate between worker variance
#' and total variance. The Compliance is achieved if the between worker variance is lower
#' than 0.2 of the total variance. Contrarily, there is Non-Compliance.
#' @param seg data of SEG under assessment
#' @param measurements samples concentrations of the agent
#' @param workers workers codes/names/ID
#' @return BW < 0.2totalVariance ("Compliant"), BW > 0.2totalVariance ("Not Compliant")
#' @export

phase3_BoHS.NvVA <- function(seg, workers, measurements)
```

``` r
#'Phase 3, BOHS/NVVA 2011 - Individual Compliance
#'
#' Individual Compliance is achieved when there is less than 20% probability that
#' workers in a SEG have more than 5% of exposure greater than the OEL.
#' @param seg data of the SEG under assessment
#' @param measurements samples concentrations of the agent
#' @param workers workers code/name
#' @param OEL Occupational Exposure Limit
#' @return BW < 0.2totalVariance, Compliant or Not Compliant
#' @export


Individual_Compliance <- function(seg, workers, measurements, OEL) 
```
